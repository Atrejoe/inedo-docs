    <p>
        <a href="/buildmaster">BuildMaster</a> helps you automate configuration and deployment of <em>other</em> software on your servers.
        To help you automate and configure BuildMaster, there are various API endpoints you can use to programmatically query or configure
        BuildMaster instances.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are several different API endpoints available:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b><a href="api/infrastructure">Infrastructure Management</a></b> - a simple mechanism for querying, creating, and updating
            <a href="../administration/agents">server</a>, <a href="../core-concepts/environments">environment</a>, and
            <a href="../administration/agents">server role</a> entries; they are intended to automate the set-up and
            management of an BuildMaster instance.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><a href="api/variables">Variables Management</a></b> - view, create, update, and delete <a href="../global-components/configuration-variables">configuration variables</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><a href="api/release-and-package">Release &amp; Package Deployment</a></b> - create and deploy releases and release packages
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><a href="api/native">Native API Methods</a></b> - callable through JSON, SOAP, or even SQL directly, these offer full control of an BuildMaster instance
            and can be used to do anything that a user may do from the web interface; these may change between minor versions (which are always
            documented in the release notes), and are almost always backwards-compatible.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        There are also <b>Release Package Triggers</b>, which allow you to create a release package by simply visiting a URL with a GET or POST; this is mostly useful when you want third-party tools to trigger release package creation within BuildMaster,
        and can be created under Application Settings &gt; Release Package Triggers
    </p>
