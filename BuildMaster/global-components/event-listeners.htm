        Event listeners are useful for monitoring the actions and operations that occur in deployment plans and pipelines in BuildMaster.
        Event Listeners trigger certain actions or tasks (such as sending an email) once the specified event occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
        BuildMaster has a handful of common built-in event listeners.

        Event listeners can be added either as a post deployment step in a <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/core-concepts/pipelines">pipeline</a> or specific to user via the <em>My Event Listener</em> user drop down.

        Organizations often use event listeners when a specific person has ownership of an application or group of applications. 
        In this scenario, the owner of the application would receive an email when a release package has been successfully deployed to production.
