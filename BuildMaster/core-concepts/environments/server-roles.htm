    <p>
      Server Roles help model the real-world overlap of servers, and provide the visualization necessary to easily understand your infrastructure. 
    </p>
    <p>
        They provide the advantage of not needing to update every plan when a server is added to or removed from a role. Adding a new web server or removing a retired database server can be done by updating the role,
        and future deployments will automatically use the new list of servers when executing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once you have created a server role, it can be used in plans and pipelines to refer to all servers in that role.

       Using server roles 
    </h2>
  
   <p>
       Server Roles can be used to deploy the same set of files to multiple servers. Refer to the <a href="/support/tutorials/buildmaster/deployments/deploying-the-same-set-of-files-to-multiple-servers-using-server-roles-in-buildmaster">tutorial</a> to learn how to accomplish this task in BuildMaster.
   </p>
   

    <h2 id="server-roles-plans">Server Roles in a Plan</h2>
    <p>
      One of the ways server roles can be used in plans is a <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/execution-engine/statements-and-blocks/loop">Loop</a> block.
      Loop blocks run the same section of a plan repeatedly, once for each item in a list.
      Inside the loop block, you can use any operations and statements you would normally use in a plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loops normally operate sequentially, with each item in the list waiting to start until all previous items are completed.
      However, we can use a <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/execution-engine/statements-and-blocks/general-blocks">General</a> block with <b>Asynchronously execute</b> enabled to run the deployment on all the servers at the same time.
