        Getting BuildMaster up-and-running takes just a few minutes: just <a href="/buildmaster/download">download</a> and
        run the installer. This guide will provide a step-by-step guide, as well provide some detail as to what's
        happening behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <h2 id="pre-install">1. Pre-Installation Check List</h2>
    <p>
        BuildMaster doesn't have any intense server requirements, and supports all modern version of Windows (7+/2008+). The recommended requirements are:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Minimum</strong> – 2 Core CPU, 2 GB RAM, 1 GB for storage
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Recommended Average/Typical</strong> – 2 Core CPU, 4 GB RAM, 10 GB storage
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Recommended Large </strong> –  4 Core CPU, 8 GB RAM, 16 GB Storage
            </li>

        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Before installing, consider the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>.NET Framework 4.5</strong> – BuildMaster requires .NET 4.5 or later; this is already installed on
            Windows Server 2012, and you can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653">download it from Microsoft</a> on
            earlier servers
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Web Server</strong> – BuildMaster has its own web server, but can also be hosted in Microsoft IIS as well;
            if you want to use IIS, make sure it <em>and</em> ASP.NET 4.5 are installed first (see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2736284">KB2736284</a> for instructions)
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Database Server </strong>– BuildMaster does require Microsoft SQL Server, but the BuildMaster installer can install
            SQL Express 2005 for you
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Firewall (Inbound)</strong> – BuildMaster is a web application and can be installed on the port of your choosing
        </li>
    </ul>


  
    <h2 id="download-buildmaster">

        2. Download BuildMaster
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are two different installation packages for BuildMaster that you can <a href="/buildmaster/download">download</a> on inedo.com
       , with the only difference being the inclusion or lack of the Microsoft SQL Express 2005 installer. If you already have your own instance of Microsoft SQL Server (any edition 2005 and later),
        then you can opt for the (significantly) smaller download that doesn't include SQL Express.
    </p>
    <h2 id="verify">
        3. Verify the Installer 
    </h2>
    <p>
        We always sign our installer packages. This signature can be seen when you run the installer and get a security warning, or right-click on the file
        for Properties and then look at Digital Signatures.
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="/resources/knowledgebase/ProGet-Installation-Guide_E6DE_image_2.png" />
    <p>
        We've never had any issues with compromised installers (it's hosted on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>, which is quite reliable),
        but it doesn't hurt to make sure the signature is there.
    </p>
    <h2 id="run-installer">
        4. Run the Installer
    </h2>
    <p>
        The installer requires administrative privileges to run and will attempt to escalate.
        It will then unpack the temporary files and begin installation verification.
    </p>

    <h2 id="license-agreement">
        5. License Agreement 
    </h2>
    <p>
        Take a quick read of our <a href="/buildmaster/license-agreement">BuildMaster license agreement</a>. Really, it's quick!
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="BuildMaster License agreement" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster-installation/license-agreement.png" />
    
    <h2 id="license-key">
        6.Edition/ License Key 
    </h2>
    <p>
        After accepting the license agreement, select the edition of BuildMaster you'd like to use (free, trial, or enter a key).
       
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="BuildMaster Edition Key" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster-installation/edition.png" />
    
    <h2 id="license-registration">
        7. License Registration
    </h2>
    <p>
        After selecting the edition, just enter your name and email. The installer will try to get this from the currently
        logged in user.
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="BuildMaster Registration" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster-installation/registration.png" />
    <h2 id="target-directory">
        8. Target Directory
    </h2>
    <p>
        Deploy to your favorite location, or just stick with the default of Program Files.
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="BuildMaster Directory" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster-installation/target-path.png" />
    <h2 id="database-configuration">
    9. Database Configuration 
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you ran the installer with the embedded SQL Express, then you'll be able to select the option to install SQL Express.
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="BuildMaster Database Configuration" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster-installation/database-configuration.png" />
    <p>
        Otherwise, you'll need to point to an existing server using a standard SQL Connection string.
        Note that if no database is specified in the connection string (which is the default), a database named BuildMaster will be created.
    </p>
    <h2 id="web-server-config">
        10. Web Server Configuration 
    </h2>
    <p>
        By default, the installer will configure BuildMaster to use its own web server. 
        This is the easiest to start with, and you can always <a href="/support/kb/1013">switch to IIS</a> hosting later.
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="BuildMaster Server Configuration" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster-installation/hosting.png" />
    <p>
        If IIS is installed on the server, you will have the option of installing BuildMaster in IIS.
        This will create an application pool and website in the local IIS configuration.
    </p>
    <h2 id="user-account">
11. User Account
    </h2>
    <p>
        By default, the installer will use the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684272(v=vs.85).aspx">NetworkService</a> account
        to run the <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/administration/service">BuildMaster Service</a> and Web Application.
        We recommend sticking with this, and <a href="/support/kb/1077">changing the account</a> later if you need to.
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="BuildMaster User account" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster-installation/user-account.png" />
    <h2 is="summary">
        12. Summary
    </h2>
    <p>
        Make sure everything here looks OK, and then click Install.
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="Installation summary" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster-installation/summary.png" />
    <p>If any of the items indicate an error, you can click on it to go back to that page and fix it.</p> 
    <h2>
        13. Patiently Wait 
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you chose to have SQL Server Express installed, then the actual installation process will take a little while.
        On embarrassingly low-end servers (e.g. Intel Celeron processor and 256MB of RAM), we've seen this take as long as fifteen minutes.
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="Patiently wait" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster-installation/patiently-wait.png" />
    <p>
        While you wait, you can always peruse <a target="_blank" title="it's exactly what you think" href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=benedict+cumberbatch+otter">Otters Who Look Like Benedict Cumberbatch</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="announcement">
        Clicking cancel (especially during the SQL Express installation) is not advised, as you may have to manually remove some bits of SQL Server
        using Add/Remove programs. Once everything's done, you'll be ready to start using BuildMaster.
    </p>
    <h2>
        14. All Done 
    </h2>
    <p>
        Click the absurdly large <b>Launch BuildMaster</b> button, and your web
        browser will start up with <code>http://localhost:&laquo;port-you-chose&raquo;/</code>.
    </p>
    <img class="screenshot" alt="Launch BuildMaster" src="/resources/documentation/buildmaster-installation/launch-buildmaster.png" />
    <p>
        Note that on slower systems, the services take a little bit to spin up, so
        if you see a blank page, just refresh the page until it loads.
    </p>

    <p>Once BuildMaster loads, we suggest going through the <a href="/buildmaster/tutorial">Getting Started with BuildMaster</a> tutorial.</p>
