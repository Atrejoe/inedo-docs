    <p>
        In order to orchestrate and deploy to servers, BuildMaster needs to be able to communicate with those servers in an
        fast and secure manner.
    </p>


    <h2 id="windows">Windows Servers</h2>
    <p>
        Communication with Windows servers is generally accomplished using a lightweight agent that's installed on the remote server.
        This agent uses a highly-optimized and resilient protocol built solely for this purpose, and is
        <a href="../installation/agent-installation-guide">quite easy to install</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Agentless Windows Servers</h3>
    <p>
        Alternatively, BuildMaster can use PowerShell Remoting to communicate with Windows servers; however, this is generally slower and
        less resilient than the Inedo Agent protocol. You can connect using integrated authentication (i.e. whatever account the service is running under), or
        with a username &amp; password <a href="../global-components/resource-credentials">resource credential</a>. See <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849694.aspx" target="_blank">Enable-PSRemoting</a>
        to configures a server to receive remote commands.
    </p>

    <h2 id="linux">Linux Servers</h2>
    <p>
        To communicate with Linux servers, BuildMaster uses the lightweight, highly-optimized, and resilient protocol already
        enabled on nearly every Linux box: SSH and SFTP. You can connect with a private key or username &amp; password
        <a href="../global-components/resource-credentials">resource credential</a>.
    </p>


    <h2 id="local">Local Agents</h2>
    <p>
        If you're using BuildMaster to interact with the server it's installed on, you can just set it up using a local agent.
        This uses the same process/identity that the <a href="service">service</a> is hosted as, and doesn't have very many privileges
        by default.
    </p>

    <h2 id="legacy">Legacy Agents</h2>
    <p>
        In BuildMaster 5.0 and earlier, a different agent model was used; to learn more about these, see <a href="/support/kb/1039">KB#1039: The Inedo Agent and Legacy BuildMaster Agents</a>.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Servers
    </h2>
    <p>
        Server are the core of your infrastructure and being able to easily manage configuration and orchestration is key to modern, scalable environments. A server represent a physical ("bare metal"), virtual server, a container, or even a yet to be provision server.
    </p>
    <p>
        BuildMaster gives you the ability to see at-a-glance the status and environment of each server.

    <h2 id="server-roles">Server Roles</h2>
    <p>
        Server roles in BuildMaster allow you to targets a group of servers in a pipeline stage, or iterate over them in deployment plans.        
    </p>

    <h3 id="server-groups">Legacy Server Groups</h3>
    <p>
        In Legacy Plans, the Server Groups feature enabled actions or action groups to target of multiple servers. They are hidden from the UI unless you have any Legacy Plans configured.
