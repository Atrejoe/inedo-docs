		A Docker feed in ProGet acts as a private registry for an organization's internal Docker images.
	</p>

	<h2>Docker Feed Limitations</h2>
	<p>
		Docker feeds are fundamentally different from other ProGet feed types. Docker feeds do not have
		any concept of <em>packages</em>. Instead, Docker works with repositories and images. A Docker
		feed contains multiple repositories, and each repository can contain one or more images. Images
		themselves are identified either by a hash, or a more friendly tag.
	</p>
	<p>
		Docker feeds also are not intended for use with anything except the Docker client. Images cannot
		be manually created or uploaded, although they can be deleted, and some metadata can be edited
		from within ProGet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Connectors cannot be used with Docker feeds. Since the Docker client uses the server name
		itself as its mechanism for identifiying when to use a private registry, there is no meaningful
		way to allow the transparent use of connectors as in other ProGet feed types.
