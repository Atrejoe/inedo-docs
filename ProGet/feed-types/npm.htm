		A ProGet npm feed is a repository compatible with the npm client for NodeJS. ProGet npm
		feeds support both scoped and unscoped npm packages.
	</p>

	<h2>npm Feed Specifics</h2>
	<p>
		Connectors to the public repository at npmjs.org will not include scoped packages
		in search results, because the public repository does not have a mechanism for
		including them. Scoped packages can still be used through this connector; they are
		only excluded from searches, and this is the same behavior seen from searching
		at npmjs.org directly.
	</p>
	<p>
		The npm client does not support using Windows Integrated Authentication, so ProGet
		attempts to disable its usage for npm API endpoints in favor of basic HTTP authentication.
		However, disabling Windows Authentication on a per-URL basis does not work in every
		environment. If you are having trouble getting this working, you may create a second
		web site in IIS for ProGet with Windows Authentication disabled without acquiring
		a separate license.
