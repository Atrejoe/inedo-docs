	<p>
		A NuGet feed in ProGet acts as a repository for NuGet packages.
		Typically, these packages are consumed from Visual Studio or a command-line client such as NuGet.exe. 
		They can also be browsed and managed from ProGet's web application
	</p>

	<h2>NuGet-Specific Feed Configuration</h2>
    <h3 id="nuget-api-key">NuGet API Key</h3>
    <p>
        If set, specifies the NuGet API key that is required to be supplied for pushing packages to
        this feed using the NuGet client. See the <a href="/support/documentation/proget/feeds/nuget/api-keys">NuGet API Keys</a> section
        for additional information about how the API key relates to authentication.
    </p>

    <h3 id="enable">Enable Symbol and Source Server</h3>
    <p>
        When set, ProGet will scan NuGet packages for .pdb files and make them available
        as a symbol server at the /symbols/[FeedName] URL. See the <a href="/support/documentation/proget/feed-types/nuget/symbol-and-source-server">Symbol Server</a>
        section for additional information.
    </p>

    <h3 id="strip">Automatically Strip PDB files</h3>
    <p>
        When set, ProGet will not include .pdb files when packages are downloaded. This
        setting is ignored when the symbol server is disabled.
