	<p>
		A <em>package</em> is a uniquely-indentified container that is
		stored in and organized by a <em>feed</em>. ProGet manages packages from
		many different types of feeds; at a minimum, all packages have a unique name,
		and most also have versions.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are many benefits to hosting packages in ProGet in your organization:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Regulate and standardize how packages are used.</li>
		<li>Cache packages from external repositories to increase productivity and reduce downtime.</li>
		<li>Simplify backup and deployment by keeping important assets in one place.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		With ProGet, you can easily vet your external third party packages to ensure that they meet
		enterprise security standards, making them available right alongside your in-house packages.
		Using <a href="/support/documentation/proget/core-concepts/connectors">connectors</a>, you can
		transparently connect to (or cache) external repositories, and optionally filter packages.
	</p>

	<h2 id="package-promotion">Package Promotion</h2>
	<p>
		Packages can be <em>promoted</em> from one feed to another. This is useful for maintaining
		feeds with separate levels of quality (such as Development, Production, etc), and also to
		easily curate selected packaged from an external source to an approved repository.
		Check out our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0uVDUt0wMjM">Promote Packages with ProGet</a>
		video for a quick look at some of the ways to use Package Promotion.

	<h2 id="deployment-records">Deployment Records</h2>
	<p>
		When a package is deployed from a feed using a tool (such as <a href="/buildmaster">BuildMaster</a>),
		ProGet records information about that deployment, such as the target and the user that
		performed the deployment.
