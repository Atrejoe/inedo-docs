	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Load Balancer - </b> This will direct traffic bound for the ProGet interface, evenly distributing traffic during heavy load times.</li>
		<li><b>Web Nodes - </b> These run the ProGet web site and API endpoints, and receive load-balancer traffic.</li>
		<li><b>Shared Storage - </b>A shared file system is needed for your important assets and must be available to all nodes.</li>
		<li><b>Database - </b>An external database (SQL Server) used by all web and indexing nodes.</li>
