		<h2>Manual ProGet Installation</h2>
		<p class="announcement">
			These manual installation instructions for ProGet are primarily for load balanced and high availability installations.
			If you aren't using these features, you should probably use the <a href="/proget/download">installer</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			ProGet consists of 3 main deployable components:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Web Application</b> – an ASP.NET 4.0 web application which serves as an interface to ProGet and serves the NuGet API
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Service</b> – performs indexing and other background tasks; hosts the web application if IIS is not used
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Database</b> – a SQL Server database which contains all of the persistent data including feeds and privileges
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Installation</h3>
		<p>
			Prior to installation of ProGet, a ProGet 
			"home" directory needs to be created, such as C:\ProGet
		</p>
		<p>
			For the remainder of these instructions and simplicity, we will use <b>C:\ProGet</b> as 
			the root - replace with the specific path you have chosen for your installation 
			as necessary.
		</p>

		<h4>ProGet's Identity</h4>
		<p>
			ProGet may be configured to use its own domain account or may run as 
			<i>Network Service</i> as long as the account has read/write access to the packages directory.
		</p>

		<h4>Database Installation</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Create a database called ProGet on the desired server
			</li>
			<li>
				Unzip <b>ProGet-DbChangeScripts.zip</b> into any directory an run the 
				executable and select option 3 (update). <b>Note</b>: if you are not running 
				SQL Server using the Default Instance or you are not running the .exe on the 
				same server as the database engine, you will have to manually update the 
				connection string within the bmdbupdate executable by choosing option "C" 
				prior to updating. 
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Service Installation</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a directory named <b>Service\</b> under <b>C:\ProGet\</b></li>
			<li>Unzip <b>ProGet-Service.zip</b> into <b>C:\ProGet\Service\</b></li>
			<li>
				Edit <b>ProGet.Service.exe.config</b> to ensure the following setting: 
				<ul>
					<li><b>InedoLib.DbConnectionString</b> (if on remote server or different instance)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Install the service. To do this, run <b>ProGet.Service.exe</b> and display help to discover
				the arguments for the "install" option. Administrator elevation is required to install the
				service and reserve URLs for self-hosted installations. If you do not reserve a URL the
				integrated web server will not be enabled.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h4>Web Application Installation</h4>
		<p>
			The web application may be hosted either by IIS or self-hosted by the integrated web server
			hosted by the service depending on how the service was installed above.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Create a directory named <b>WebApp\</b> under <b>C:\ProGet\</b></li>
			<li>Unzip <b>ProGet-WebApp.zip</b> into <b>C:\ProGet\WebApp\</b></li>
			<li>
				Edit <b>Web.config</b> to ensure the following setting: 
				<ul>
					<li><b>InedoLib.DbConnectionString</b> (if on remote server or different instance)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			For IIS hosted applications, there are 2 additional steps:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				Create an application pool in IIS to run under the appropriate identity; 
				for IIS7 and later, a classic (non-integrated) pipeline must be used
			</li>
			<li>
				Create a website that points to <b>C:\ProGet\WebApp</b> using 
				whichever host name configuration or ports preferred. <b>Note</b>: A virtual 
				directory is not supported at this time. Note: If IIS6 is used, verify that 
				the website is configured for ASP.NET 4.0.
			</li>
		</ol>
