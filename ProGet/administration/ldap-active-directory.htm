      <h2 id="integrated">Integrated Authentication</h2>
      <p>
          When using either the LDAP
          or Domain Forest 
          user directories, ProGet allows the use of Windows Integrated Authentication. This allows
          users to implicitly use their domain user profile to log in without
          seeing a login prompt in ProGet. Certain tools such as nuget.exe also
          support Windows Authentication and may be usable without explicit credentials.
      </p>

      <h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
      <p>
          If ProGet is hosted in IIS, Windows Authentication must be enabled for
          the ProGet web site. If using the integrated web server, no additional
          configuration is required.
      </p>
      <h2 id="directory">LDAP Directory</h2>
      <p>
          An LDAP directory uses the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol to query
          the users and groups of an external database. By default, this option will
          connect to the Active Directory domain that the ProGet server is a member of.
          For advanced or non-Active Directory scenarios, some additional configuration
          may be required; please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>
          if this is the case, and we will work with you to get things configured.
      </p>

      <h3 id="users">LDAP Users</h3>
      <p>
          Like the built in user directory, LDAP users must also have unique names.
          Note that when connected to an Active Directory Domain, the user name
          will <b>not</b> include the actual domain name for this directory.
      </p>

      <h3 id="groups">LDAP Groups</h3>
      <p>
          Groups in LDAP may contain users or other groups. ProGet will attempt to
          determine group membership recursively, but may not always recognize every
          type of group. For example, certain computed groups in Active Directory
          such as Domain Users may not work in ProGet.
      </p>
      <h2 id="forest">Domain Forest Directory</h2>
      <p>
          This directory is similar to the LDAP directory, but is designed exclusively
          for Active Directories that include multiple domains. Because an explicit domain
          is required for every principal name, this adds a fair amount of complexity and
          performance overhead, and should only be used if the LDAP/Single Domain directory
          is inadequate for your organization.
      </p>

      <h3 id="active-users">Active Directory Users</h3>
      <p>
          Users in this directory have unique names across the entire domain forest. As such,
          they are specified in the format: user@my.full.domain
      </p>
      <p>
          Aside from the name, multi-domain AD users function identically to any other
          type of user in ProGet.
      </p>

      <h3 id="active-groups">Active Directory Groups</h3>
      <p>
          Like the LDAP directory, AD groups in may contain users or other groups.
          ProGet will attempt to determine group membership recursively, but may
          not always recognize every type of group. For example, certain computed
          groups in Active Directory such as Domain Users may not work in ProGet.
      </p>
      <p>
          Like users, groups must be fully qualified. For example: Developers@my.full.domain
      </p>
