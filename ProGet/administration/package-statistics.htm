       ProGet's Package Statistics feature gives users the ability to obtain important metrics about their packages downloaded in ProGet.
       This feature is enabled from the admin page by going to Administration > Advanced Settings and checking the <em> Package Statistics enabled</em> box. 
   </p>
      <p>
          A ProGet Basic license is currently required to enable the Package Statistics feature. 
     
          When enabled, you can navigate to your packages and view statistics to see download details.

      <p>
          Note that ProGet also supports querying package statistics from database. Each download record is recorded in the <code>PackageDownloads</code> table.
