      <p>
          Repository packages/artifacts are generally stored on disk, while much of
          their metadata is stored in a database for quick access. If there is a mismatch
          between the metadata the actual package (for example, if someone deletes
          a file from the storage directory), then undefined behavior can result.
      </p>
      <p>
          To help prevent issues with incorrect metadata, ProGet verifies the package
          metadata during a <i>feed cleanup</i> task. By default, these cleanup tasks
          run in the background once a day, but they can also be invoked directly
          from the web application.
      </p>
      <p>
          ProGet also runs a feed's <a href="/support/documentation/proget/administration/retention-policies">retention rules</a>
          during cleanup.
      </p>
      <h3 id="scheduled-tasks">Scheduled Tasks</h3>
      <p>
          Scheduled tasks are potentially long-running operations that ProGet
          occassionally needs to perform in the background. Examples of scheduled
          tasks include <a href="/support/documentation/proget/administration/feed-cleanup">feed cleanup</a>
          and connector indexing.
      </p>
      <p>
          A list of all scheduled tasks currently defined is available on the <i>Scheduled Tasks</i>
          page, which is accessible from the main ProGet administration page. Individual tasks can be
          rescheduled or completely disabled by clicking the corresponding edit icons. A task can
          be run immediately by clicking the green play button.
      </p>
      <p>
          ProGet maintains logs for past executions of scheduled tasks. These logs may be useful in the
          event of a failure, but normally do not need to be consulted. To view a list of all previous
          task executions, click the small [view history] link for that task.
