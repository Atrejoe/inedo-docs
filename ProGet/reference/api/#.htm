    <p>
        As a Universal Package Manager, ProGet offers APIs for all of the different feed types. But there are also API endpoints that help you 
        automate and ProGet itself.
    </p>
    

    <h2 id="feed-specific">Feed-specific APIs</h2>
    <p>
        With the exception of the <a href="universal-feed-api-and-package-format">Universal Feed API</a>, the documentation for feed-specific APIs
        (such as NuGet, npm, etc) is generally found within that product's documentation. We attempt to implement their API as documented and -- more often than not--
        as undocumented.
    </p>

        <p>
            As we are with the <a href="/support/documentation/otter/reference/api">Otter APIs</a> and <a href="/support/documentation/buildmaster/reference/api">BuildMaster APIs</a>,
            we will continue to add simpler endpoints to ProGet that will be easier to consume than the Native API.

        <ul>
            <li><a href="api/package-promotion"><b>Package Promotion</b></a> - query promotions and promote packages between feeds</li>
            <li class="upcoming"><b>Security Management</b> - users, groups, directories, and permissions</li>
            <li class="upcoming"><b>Feed Configuration</b> - create and configure feeds</li>
        </ul>

            If you have any interest in these or ideas for others, please <a href="/contact">let us know</a>.

    <h2 id="native-api">ProGet Native API</h2>
    <p>
        The ProGet Native API is a lower-level API that's designed to automate installation and management of a ProGet instance. It's not terribly intuitive,
        but its documented here: <a href="api/native">ProGet Native API Reference</a>
    </p>

    <h2 id="json-api">JSON API</h2>
    <p>
        The JSON API is the recommended method for technologies other than .NET to interface with ProGet. Refer to the <a href="/support/documentation/proget/reference/api/json">documentation</a> for more information.
