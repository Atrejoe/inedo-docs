	<h2>What is Otter?</h2>
    <p>
        Otter is modern infrastructure automation that utilizes Infrastructure as Code to help teams and enterprises with:    
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Configuration Automation</b>
            - model the configuration of <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/servers">Servers</a>, <a href="/support/documentation/otter/modeling-infrastructure/server-roles">Roles</a>, and <a href="/support/documentation/otter/modeling-infrastructure/environments">Environments</a>; monitor for <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/servers#drift">Drift</a>, schedule changes, and ensure consistency across servers</li>
        <li>
            <b>Orchestration Automation</b>
            - spin up cloud servers, build containers, deploy packages, patch servers, or any other multi-server/service automation
        </li>
    </ul>
	<p>Otter was created with the idea that a visual, intuitive interface is a necessary feature from the start to bring better understanding to an organization's complex and changing infrastructure.</p>

   
    <h2>Who uses Otter?</h2>
    <p>
        Otter was built to get the whole team involved and further everyone's understanding of the infrastructure they use, rather than a handful of elite specialists.
	</p>
	<p>
		Generally, Developers and Operations personnel create automation plans and schedule <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/jobs">Jobs</a>, while Testers, Governance, Managers, and other IT members can see configuration, drift, and logs of what changed and when. This helps everyone understand the organization’s rapidly changing infrastructure.
