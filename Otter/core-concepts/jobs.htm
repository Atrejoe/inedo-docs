		Jobs allows you to <a href="plans">remediate configuration drift</a> and <a href="plans">run orchestration plans</a>, either on-demand, at a scheduled time, 
        or on a recurring basis. They can help to minimize downtime and can be set to run when convenient or most appropriate for your enterprises. 
        Jobs give you the control of when, where, and how your infrastructure changes. 
	</p>
	<p>
	    Jobs ultimately target <a href="servers">Servers</a>, and can do so either directly (by specifying a list of servers), or indirectly 
        (by specifying <a href="../modeling-infrastructure/server-roles">Server Roles</a> and/or 
        <a href="../modeling-infrastructure/environments">Environments</a>). And just as there are two types of plans, there are effectively the same two types of jobs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b><a href="#configuration">Configuration Job</a></b> -
            remediates configuration drift by bringing the targeted servers to their desired configuration
        </li>
        <li>
            <b><a href="#orchestration">Orchestration Job</a></b> -
            runs a specified orchestration plan against the targeted servers
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
         Either type of jobs can be run immediately (for example, test servers in unexpected drift), at scheduled times in the future 
        (planned changes to a production server), or on a recurring basis (adding more servers at known peak times). 
    </p>

    <h2 id="configuration">Configuration Jobs</h2>
    <p>
        When there is <a href="servers#drift">configuration drift</a> on a server or role (and you have permission to create a configuration job),
        you can simply click the Remdiate Drift button to schedule a configuration job.
    </p>

	</p>
    <p>
        You can also create a configuration job by clicking on [Jobs] &gt; [Create Job], or create a recurring configuration job (such as updating production
        servers onces a week) by [Jobs] &gt; [Recuring] &gt; [Create Recurring Job].
    </p>
    <h2 id="orchestration">Orchestration Jobs</h2>
    <p>
        Orchestration jobs are created on the jobs page, and require the selection of an orchestration plan and servers to run against.
    </p>

    </p>
    
    <h3 id="job-templates">Job Templates</h3>
    <p>
        You can also define a job template under [Admin] &gt; [Job Templates]; these can be used to pre-populate fields in an orchestration job, and
        also allow for jobs to be triggered using the <a href="../reference/api/jobs">Job Orchestration API</a>.
    </p>

    </p>

	<h2 id="simulation">Simulation Job Runs</h2>
	<p>
	    You can run a job in a simulation mode, which will run all of the steps in any plan without making any changes to the targeted servers. When a simulation 
        is run Otter, will still follow the logic you define in your plan, and log all of the things it's doing, and will log the changes that <em>would</em> have 
        been made if the job was running normally. This can be helpful when running jobs against unknown servers, remediating unexpected drift, or performing changes on high value servers. 
	</p>

    </p>
	<p>
	    Simulating a job can help ensure future accuracy by finding any errors that might have occurred in a plan, without effecting current configurations.
