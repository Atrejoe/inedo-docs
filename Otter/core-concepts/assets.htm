        Assets make it easier to automate your infrastructure by leveraging existing scripts and other files to effortlessly create 
        <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/plans">Configuration and Orchestration Plans</a>
        and scale up. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Moreover, you can restrict access to your assets by creating 
        <a href="../global-components/rafts">
        Rafts</a> in various <a href="../modeling-infrastructure/environments">Environments</a> to assets to specific environments.
        This helps maintain and enhance compliance and security, and helps you build on the existing knowledge, tools, and scripts you have already invested in.

    <h2 id="powershell">PowerShell &amp; Shell Scripts</h2>
    <p>
        Otter's <a href="../modeling-infrastructure/powershell">Tight PowerShell &amp; Scripting Integration</a> makes it incredibly easy 
        to use your current scripts to automate your current infrastructure. Once you've added a PowerShell or Shell script as an asset, you can 
        call it as an operation in a <a href="plans">Configuration or Orchestration</a> plan, and Otter will execute those scripts on the
        appropriate server, and store rich logs about their execution.
    </p>

    <h2 id="template">Template Plans</h2>

    <p>
        Templates are reusable <a href="plans">Plans</a> that can be called from another plan, or another template, as if it 
        were an <a href="../reference/operations">Operation</a>. Like other plans, templates are created using the Otter Visual Mode Editor or <a href="/support/documentation/otter/reference/otter-script">OtterScript</a>, and consist of <a href="/support/documentation/otter/execution-engine/statements-and-blocks">Blocks</a>. Template reusability allows for quick plan creation and greater accuracy, by using known configuration pieces.
    </p>
    <p>Templates can be useful to spin up generic <a href="/support/documentation/otter/core-concepts/servers">Servers</a> for rapid testing in the cloud, such as a generic template to create an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Server</a> for short testing periods, or to create segments of configuration plans that will be used across different
    <a href="/support/documentation/otter/modeling-infrastructure/server-roles">Server Roles</a>.</p>    

    <h2 id="other">Other Files</h2>
    <p>
        Otter can store any file type that a server might need for configuration, such as SSL certificates, read-me text documents, license key files, etc. 
        You can even store your pictures of 
        <a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=Otters+Who+Look+Like+Benedict+Cumberbatch">Otters Who Look Like Benedict Cumberbatch</a>.
    </p>

    <p>These files can be deployed or ensured using the Get Asset and Ensure Asset operations.</p>
